# Deploying PrintUSA (Supabase + Vercel)

The app has two parts, both deployed together on Vercel:

- **Frontend** — React (Vite) → served as static files by Vercel
- **API** — Express (products + instant pricing) → Vercel Serverless Function at `/api/*`
- **Auth, orders, and design storage** — handled by **Supabase** directly from the browser

---

## 1. Set up Supabase (database + auth + storage)

1. Create a free project at <https://supabase.com>.
2. In the dashboard, open **SQL Editor → New query**, paste the contents of
   [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql), and click **Run**.
   This creates the `orders` table, row-level security, and the private `designs`
   storage bucket.
3. Open **Authentication → Providers** and make sure **Email** is enabled.
   - For quick testing you can turn **"Confirm email"** OFF (Authentication →
     Providers → Email) so new sign-ups are logged in immediately.
4. Open **Project Settings → API** and copy:
   - **Project URL** → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** key → `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

> The `anon` key is safe to expose in the browser — row-level security is what
> protects the data. Never put the **service_role** key in the frontend.

---

## 2. Run locally

```bash
npm install

# create your local env file for the frontend
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
# then edit frontend/.env and paste your Supabase URL + anon key

npm run dev
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:3000>
- API: <http://localhost:5000> (the frontend proxies `/api` to it automatically)

Without Supabase keys the storefront and instant pricing still work; login/orders
show a "connect Supabase" message.

## 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. At <https://vercel.com> → **Add New → Project** → import the repo.
3. Vercel reads [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) automatically (single Vite app at the root):
   - Framework: **Vite**, Build: `vite build`, Output: `dist`
   - `/api/*` → the serverless function in [`api/`](api/index.js)
   - all other routes → `index.html` (SPA routing)
   - **Root Directory** must be the repo root (`./`) — NOT `frontend`.
4. In **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**, add the variables below.
5. Click **Deploy**.

> **If a build fails with "Root Directory 'frontend' does not exist":** an old
> project setting is stuck. Go to **Project → Settings → Build and Deployment →
> Root Directory**, clear it (leave empty = repo root), Save, and Redeploy.

### Environment variables

**Frontend (browser-safe):**
| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon public key |
| `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` | comma-separated staff emails (shows the Admin link) |

**Server (API — keep secret):**
| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | same Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase **service_role** key (Settings → API) |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key (`sk_...`) — enables payments |
| `ADMIN_EMAILS` | comma-separated staff emails (enforced by the API) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | [Resend](https://resend.com) API key — enables order emails |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | e.g. `PrintUSA <orders@yourdomain.com>` (Resend-verified domain) |

Payments, admin, and emails activate only once their keys are set — without them the
store still runs and shows "not enabled yet" messages. See `.env.example` for a template.

### Email notifications (Resend)
1. Create a free account at <https://resend.com> → **API Keys → Create** → copy the `re_...` key into `RESEND_API_KEY`.
2. **Domains → Add Domain** and verify yours (DNS records), then set `EMAIL_FROM` to an address on it (e.g. `orders@yourdomain.com`).
   - *Quick test without a domain:* leave `EMAIL_FROM` unset — it defaults to `onboarding@resend.dev`, which only delivers to the email you signed up to Resend with.
3. Emails sent: **order confirmation** (to customer) + **new-order alert** (to `ADMIN_EMAILS`) on every order, and a **status-update email** whenever you change an order's status in the admin dashboard.

### Coupons
Edit the code list in [`backend/data/coupons.js`](backend/data/coupons.js). Starter codes: `WELCOME10`, `SAVE25`, `FREESHIP`, `FIRST20`.

### Stripe webhook (reliable payment status — recommended for production)
Without a webhook, an order is only marked **paid** when the customer returns from
Stripe. A webhook marks it paid reliably even if they close the tab.
1. Stripe Dashboard → **Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint**.
2. Endpoint URL: `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Events to send: **`checkout.session.completed`**.
4. Copy the **Signing secret** (`whsec_...`) into the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var and redeploy.

### Scaling & safety notes
- **Idempotency:** orders carry an `idempotency_key`, so double-clicks/retries can't create duplicates (unique index in the schema).
- **Rate limiting:** write endpoints (checkout, coupon, quote, notify) are limited to 40 req/min per IP. It's in-memory per serverless instance; for a hard global limit, add a shared store (e.g. Upstash Redis).
- **High-volume bursts:** on a large simultaneous spike, upgrade **Resend** (free tier is 100 emails/day) and consider batching the admin new-order alerts into a digest. Order saving never blocks on email — email failures are ignored.
6. After the first deploy, add your Vercel URL to Supabase under
   **Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL / Redirect URLs**
   (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`).

## Architecture at a glance

```
Browser (React on Vercel)
 ├── /api/products, /api/price   → Vercel Serverless (Express)  [no DB]
 ├── Supabase Auth               → login / register / session
 ├── Supabase Postgres (orders)  → protected by row-level security
 └── Supabase Storage (designs)  → uploaded & drawn artwork (private)
```

## What still needs a real business decision later
- **Payments** (Stripe) — currently orders are submitted as requests, not paid.
- **Admin dashboard** — staff view of all orders (add an `is_staff` policy).
- **Email notifications** on new orders (Supabase Edge Function or a service).
